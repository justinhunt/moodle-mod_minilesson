The final element of the array \">>announce\" is a sound effect and should not change.\n* a set of 3 possible next responses to the conversation (answers) . Only the first response is plausible. The other two responses are understandale but are not plausible in the context. The conversation should be formatted as a one dimensional array of strings, like this: [\"It costs seven dollars.\", \"I live on that street\", \"At the second stop\"]\n* an image creation prompt (data1) to help the student understand the context of the conversation. The image prompt should specify the style \"{imagestyle}\" and that the image should contain no text, captions or speech bubbles.\n\n\nEach question also requires a short question review document (data2) in markdown format.
